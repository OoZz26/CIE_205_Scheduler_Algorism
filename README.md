# Process Scheduler

This project, "Process Scheduler," is associated with the Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course at Zewail City University of Science and Technology. The main objectives of scheduling are to optimize the use of resources, keep the CPU as busy as possible, have maximum utilization of the CPU, minimize response time and waiting time for processes being scheduled, and ensure load balancing among different processors in multiprocessor systems.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a program that simulates the operation of the process scheduler in a multiprocessor system. Additionally, the program calculates relevant statistics to help improve the overall scheduling system.

We have implemented all the necessary data structures and their corresponding functions from scratch. The following data structures have been implemented:

1. Queue
2. Priority Queue
3. Linked List
4. Queues of Struct

We have also implemented the following scheduling algorithms:

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Round Robin (RR)

## Process Scheduling Criteria and Flow

To ensure comprehensive functionality, we have implemented the following process scheduling criteria and flow:

1. Process Migration
2. Work Stealing
3. Process Forking
4. Kill Orphan Process
5. Kill Signal
6. I/O Request Handling
7. Process Completion
8. Reading Input from File

## Considerations

During the implementation of this project, we have taken the following considerations into account:

1. Memory Management
2. Object-Oriented Concepts (Modularity, Maintainability, and Class Responsibilities)
3. Optimal Performance through the Best Data Structures

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OoZz26/CIE_205_Scheduler_Algorithm.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd CIE_205_Scheduler_Algorithm`
3. Compile the source code: `gcc -o process-scheduler main.c`
4. Run the program: `./process-scheduler`

You can find the project repository [here](https://github.com/OoZz26/CIE_205_Scheduler_Algorithm).

Please ensure you have the necessary dependencies and a compatible C compiler installed before compiling and running the program.
