# CIE_205_Scheduler_Algorithm
Process Scheduler
License

This project, "Process Scheduler," is associated with the Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course at Zewail City University of Science and Technology. The main objectives of scheduling are to optimize the use of resources, keep the CPU as busy as possible, have maximum utilization of the CPU, minimize response time and waiting time for processes being scheduled, and ensure load balancing among different processors in multiprocessor systems.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a program that simulates the operation of the process scheduler in a multiprocessor system. Additionally, the program calculates relevant statistics to help improve the overall scheduling system.

We have implemented all the necessary data structures and their corresponding functions from scratch. The following data structures have been implemented:

Queue
Priority Queue
Linked List
Queues of Struct
We have also implemented the following scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Shortest Job First (SJF)
Round Robin (RR)
Process Scheduling Criteria and Flow
To ensure comprehensive functionality, we have implemented the following process scheduling criteria and flow:

Process Migration
Work Stealing
Process Forking
Kill Orphan Process
Kill Signal
I/O Request Handling
Process Completion
Reading Input from File
Considerations
During the implementation of this project, we have taken the following considerations into account:

Memory Management
Object-Oriented Concepts (Modularity, Maintainability, and Class Responsibilities)
Optimal Performance through the Best Data Structures
